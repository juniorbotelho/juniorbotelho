### Hi, I'm Junior Botelho :fox_face:

Thank you for visiting me! Let me tell you a little bit about myself.

I am a web application developer, my favorite language is Javascript with Typescript, but I also like to program in other languages like PHP, C#, Swift and Kotlin.

My biggest time spent is programming, I don't like to take it just as work, because I have a lot of fun when I'm in front of the computer creating something and drinking a good cup of coffee.

Well, presentations aside, feel free.
